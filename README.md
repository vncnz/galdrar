# galdrar

Galdrar is the plural of galdr: in norse mythology, it is a song, a spell, an incantation.

Please note that this is a personal project, for personal use, developed in my (not so much) free time. You'll not find clean code or a flexible, modular system here. You'll find lots of experiments, abandoned ideas, dead code, temporary hacks and workarounds. Oh, and last but not least, I'm just learning both Rust and RataTUI. You've been warned.
